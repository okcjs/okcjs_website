OKC.js depends on sponsors to provide food and drinks for the meetings, to cover travel and lodging costs of out-of-state guest speakers, to help contribute to community events and meeting spaces, and to cover other costs associated with running the group. If your company would like to sponsor OKC.js, please contact [Jesse Harlin](mailto:harlinjesse@gmail.com) or [Vance Lucas](mailto:vance@vancelucas.com).
