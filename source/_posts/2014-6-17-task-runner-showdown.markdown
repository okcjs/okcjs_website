## About our Speakers

### Josh Bavari
If you're working on any Web or Node.js projects, certainly you know about Grunt.js (the javascript task runner). The question may arise, are there any other JS build tools out there to leverage? And how much can you really do with these systems? Let's dive into some JS build systems like Grunt.js and Gulp.js and push them to the limits.
