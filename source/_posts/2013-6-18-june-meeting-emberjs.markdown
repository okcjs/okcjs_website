##"About "Ember.js" 

###Light Your Fires for Ember

Ember Js bills itself as a framework for creating ambitious web applications. Its a strong system integrating data binding, templates, and common idioms so you can focus on what makes a web app special, without reinventing the wheel. Perhaps you've worked in other frameworks, and have wondered what makes Ember exceptional. 

Now is your chance to learn, and Jeremy Green is going to be your guide on a titillating code safari deep into the trenches of Ember.

## About our Speakers

### Jeremy Green
I'm a hard-working, entrepreneurial, full-stack web engineer.  I believe in test-driven development, minimum viable products, short iterations, fat models, skinny controllers, version control, feature branches, automated deployment, performance as a feature, 24x7 monitoring, proactive detection of problems, and using the right tool for each job.  I engineer scalable solutions to allow infrastructure costs to rise and fall with demand.
