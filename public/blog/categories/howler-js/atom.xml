<h2>"About "Howler.js"</h2>

<p>Audio sucks on the web. Thankfully, there is a great library that helps with that : Howler.js. Howler can help with a variety of web audio needs, with graceful fallbacks to HTML5 Audio. Howler.js is a library that makes playing back audio in JavaScript simpler.  It allows you to control when it starts and stops, looping, fading in and out, playback of multiple sounds at the same time, support for multiple codecs and more..</p>
