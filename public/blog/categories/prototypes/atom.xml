<h2>This Month</h2>

<p>Meeting November 27, 2012 @The Exchange</p>

<p>"Prototype Warriors"</p>

<h2>About our Speakers</h2>

<h3>Dennis Ferron</h3>

<p>I'm a graduate of the computer science program from Southwestern Oklahoma State University.

I did an engineering intership with NASA at the Johnson Space Center in Houston.  I currently work as a .NET developer for Love's Country Stores and Travel Stops.</p>

<h3>Jonathan Camenisch</h3>
