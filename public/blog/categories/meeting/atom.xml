Frisby is a REST API testing framework built on node.js and Jasmine that makes testing API endpoints easy, fast, and fun.  Frisby.js is invented by Vance Lucas</p>

<p>The second presentation will cover D3. D3 is a avaScript library for manipulating documents based on data. D3 helps you bring data to life using HTML, SVG and CSS. D3's emphasis on web standards gives you the full capabilities of modern browsers without tying yourself to a proprietary framework, combining powerful visualization components and a data-driven approach to DOM manipulation.</p>

<h2>About our Speakers</h2>

<h3>Vance Lucas</h3>

<p>Vance Lucas created his first website at the age of 12 and has been focused on web development ever since. Driven to learn more about the web to make better and more interactive websites, Vance taught himself programming with PHP and MySQL back when PHP3 was new at the age of 13. Since PHP5's release, Vance has been focused on and obsessed with object-oriented programming and the advantages it has over the traditional PHP procedural coding style. Vance created the phpDataMapper ORM library as a project to demonstrate the benefits of object-oriented code and the Standard PHP Library (SPL). Vance launched InvoiceMore, an invoicing web application as the flagship product of Actridge, LLC, a company that he founded in February 2009. Vance has recently co-founded a new business called Brightbit doing client work and consulting.</p>

<h3>Jesse Harlin</h3>

<p>Howdy! I am developer at NineCollective who specializes in client side technologies. I am an 'alpha nerd', I love my work, and I am super enthsiastic about things like Javascript, Html/Css and Unity 3D. I've been working in the web for nearly a decade, and am especially excited about the incredible attention javascript has recieved lately as a programming language. When I am not programming at work I am probably programming at home. I love using code to write algorithmic music, program robots, automate Blender, create new electronic musical instruments, and make interactive media. When I am not doing that, I am working to help enrich the programming usergroup communities, both by participating and leading.</p>

<h2>This Month: Heads Up! Location Change!</h2>

<p>The Div was an awesome place to hold our meetings for a long time. The Div is evolving now, and <a href="http://thediv.org/2012/06/18/our-new-focus-and-pivot/">shifting its focus to better serve the Oklahoma Tech Community</a>. Since they are focusing on inspiring a new generation of developers, their facility this month will be used to host a Scratch Camp, and in the future they will focus more on <a href="http://thediv.org/div-jr-program/">Div Jr</a>.</p>

<p>We are thankful for the awesome time we spent there! However, now we
need to meet at a differnt location, so for this month we are going to
meet at <a href="http://www.metrotech.edu/campuses/edc.html">MetroTech Economic Development Center</a> in <strong>Room 114</strong> (<a href="http://goo.gl/maps/2L30">view map</a>). For this building on campus you should park in Lot I, and the entrance is either entry 13 or 14.</p>

<p>Here are some maps to help you find us:<br/>
 * <a href="http://goo.gl/maps/3uo6">How to get to Metro Tech Springlake Campus</a><br/>
 * <a href="http://www.metrotech.edu/campuses/springlakemap.pdf">A Map of the Springlake Campus (pdf)</a></p>

<h3>Its time to take your visualization capabilities to the next level</h3>

<p><a href="http://processingjs.org">Processing.js</a> is the sister project of the popular Processing visual programming language, designed for the web. Processing.js makes your data visualizations, digital art, interactive animations, educational graphs, video games, etc. work using web standards and without any plug-ins. You write code using the Processing language, include it in your web page, and Processing.js does the rest. It's not magic, but almost.</p>

<p>Yury is going to help us get started with Processing.js. There is a reason Processing is highly popular with lots of creative people. Processing.js brings the best of visual programming to the web, both for Processing and web developers.   Processing can help you achieve practical goals, but it can also be a means for self expression. If you've been amazed at some of the cool things happening in the browser, and are interested in being a part of the exciting changes javascript is bringing to modern development; don't miss this meeting!</p>

In one corner we have Micah Choquette, who will teach you how to adapt your application to any viewing environment. You can 'Parry and Block' and 'Slip and Turn', as a whole host of viewing resolutions and devices get thrown at your app. In the other corner, we have Michael Sarchet who will teach you how to create a highly interactive experince with knockout.js. Use the power of MVVM to Cross, Hook and Jab your clientside viewmodel. Your pages will float like a butterfly and sting like a bee!</p>

<p>Its time to weigh in. The browser is waiting for your challenge!!</p>

<h2>About "Ninjas of the Javascript"</h2>

<p>Meeting March 20, 2012 from 11:30am - 12:30pm at <a href="http://thediv.org">the &lt;div&gt;</a> in Edmond, OK. Batteries not included, but lunch is!</p>

<h3>A Frontal Assault</h3>

<p>Last month, we highlighted some of the awesome things happening with
serverside javascript. Now,  this month we want to highlight some
awesome uses of javascript for the client, and for frontend designers.
We have two awesome presentations lined up that will demonstrate the
diversity and usefulness of javascript in your workflow.</p>

<h3>Photoshop Automation With Javascript</h3>

<p>Javascript is everwhere, and if you frequently work in programs such as
image editors, video editors and sound editors you might be surprised to
find Javascript in the most unlikely of places. That means as a
developer or designer, harnessing the power of scripting gives you an
incredible edge. Photoshop gives you the ability to implement javascript
for a variety of tasks, which can save you time. It is time to learn the
ancient secrets of Photoshop, and Dragon Punchâ„¢ your photoshop workflow
with the power of Javascript.</p>

<h3>Effective Clientside Patterns with the jQuery UI Widget factory</h3>

<p>Many of you use jQuery, and similarly, many of you use jQuery UI. Its
time to go beyond simply using the presets and default widgets in your
jQuery UI library. In this talk, we will cover how $.widget really
works, and how beyond its surface, using the widget factory can help you
write elegant and well organized javascript code in your next
application. Do not attend expecting a blow by blow demonstration of the
default widgets. Instead, this is for those who are looking for ways to
organize their codebase with good patterns and solve their own unique
problems with jQuery UI.  Shadow Kickâ„¢ your web application's clientside
codebase with the awesome javascript conventions, CSS conventions and
state management afforded by jQuery UI!</p>

<h2>Rock Your World with Node.js and Socket.io!</h2>

<p>We already have a robust usergroup in terms of size, and we are attempting something ambitious - a live coding session with audience participation. We will have two speakers at our coding session, Ben Van Treese, and Rob Sullivan. Bring your laptops to the meeting if you want to participate and be blown away by live websocket awesomeness.</p>

<p>First, Ben is going to help you go full throttle from neophyte to awesome in the exciting world of Node. We are going to first cover the basics of node and then construct a small node app for the first part of the meeting. This should be a perfect entry point for those new to node, but should also be practical for those at a novice skill level. Then we will cover some more advanced material. Rob is going to join in and simulate an Enterprise environment and load for our app. Everyone interested in Node.js, websockets, and real-time communications should get something out of this presentation.</p>
