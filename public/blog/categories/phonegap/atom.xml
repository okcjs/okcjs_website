<h2>"About "Phonegap"</h2>

<p>Are you excited about all the mobile technologies available today but you can’t decide which language to learn? Is your company planning to build a mobile app but you can’t decide which platform to invest in first? The answer is simple: don’t choose! In this session I will show you how you can use the PhoneGap framework to build an app using just HTML, Javascript and CSS that will compile to a native app. Along the way, I’ll point out various performance tips, helper libraries and design patters to make your app experience awesome on all devices. Your app will be ready for submission to each platform’s app store and will install and run natively all from a single code base!</p>
