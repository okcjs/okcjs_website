<p><img class="float-left rounded-corner-all frisby-js" src="/images/logos/logo-frisby.png" width="250" title="&#34;Double Javascript D3 + FrisbyJs&#34;" alt="&#34;Double Javascript D3 + FrisbyJs&#34;">The first presentation will be on Frisby.js. Frisby is a REST API testing framework built on node.js and Jasmine that makes testing API endpoints easy, fast, and fun.  Frisby.js is invented by Vance Lucas</p>

<p>The second presentation will cover D3. D3 is a avaScript library for manipulating documents based on data. D3 helps you bring data to life using HTML, SVG and CSS. D3's emphasis on web standards gives you the full capabilities of modern browsers without tying yourself to a proprietary framework, combining powerful visualization components and a data-driven approach to DOM manipulation.</p>

<h2>About our Speakers</h2>

<h3>Vance Lucas</h3>

<p>Vance Lucas created his first website at the age of 12 and has been focused on web development ever since. Driven to learn more about the web to make better and more interactive websites, Vance taught himself programming with PHP and MySQL back when PHP3 was new at the age of 13. Since PHP5's release, Vance has been focused on and obsessed with object-oriented programming and the advantages it has over the traditional PHP procedural coding style. Vance created the phpDataMapper ORM library as a project to demonstrate the benefits of object-oriented code and the Standard PHP Library (SPL). Vance launched InvoiceMore, an invoicing web application as the flagship product of Actridge, LLC, a company that he founded in February 2009. Vance has recently co-founded a new business called Brightbit doing client work and consulting.</p>

<h3>Jesse Harlin</h3>

<p>Howdy! I am developer at NineCollective who specializes in client side technologies. I am an 'alpha nerd', I love my work, and I am super enthsiastic about things like Javascript, Html/Css and Unity 3D. I've been working in the web for nearly a decade, and am especially excited about the incredible attention javascript has recieved lately as a programming language. When I am not programming at work I am probably programming at home. I love using code to write algorithmic music, program robots, automate Blender, create new electronic musical instruments, and make interactive media. When I am not doing that, I am working to help enrich the programming usergroup communities, both by participating and leading.</p>
