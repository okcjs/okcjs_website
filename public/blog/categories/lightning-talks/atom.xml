<h2>About "Lightning Talks"</h2>

<p>Lightning Talks are a lot of fun. Its an open forum where our members can get up and talk about what they want. The talks need to be short - generally 5-10 minutes. You can cover anything that is javascript, or related to javascript. You can talk about a problem you've solved, a plugin you like, a cool blog post you read, something you're working on now, or pretty much any other way you're using javascript to achieve your goals.</p>

<p>Since these tend to be pretty popular, we've started a 'signup' on the Google + page. By 'signup' I meann "post a comment in the thread". It's basically first come, first serve. Or FIFO. Whatever :)</p>

<h2>About our Speakers</h2>

<h3>Thats You!</h3>

<p>This month it is all about you, our Okcjs Members. This meeting will be entirely user driven. Have you been working on something cool you want to share? Have you come across a useful plugin lately? Have you recently solved a hard problem with javascript or related technologies? Now is your chance to present it!</p>

<p>This is pretty informal. If you don't sign up, you can still talk if there's time, and if you do sign up you can change your mind. Ithe signup is just so if anyone really wants to talk they can be guaranteed a spot, is all.</p>

<h3>Our Sponsors</h3>

<p>Tasty lunch will be served thanks to <a href="http://www.roberthalftechnology.com/">Robert Half Technologies</a>. These awesome folks are passionate about serving the Oklahoma City technology community and we thank them for their generous support. They've made it clear they want to see our usergroup succeed, which is an epic win for everyone!</p>
