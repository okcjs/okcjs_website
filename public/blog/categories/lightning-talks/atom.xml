<h2>About "Lightning Talks V"</h2>

<p>Lightning Talks are super ultimate to the extreme. Its an open forum where our members can get up and talk about what they want. The talks need to be short - generally 5-10 minutes. You can cover anything that is javascript, or related to javascript. You can talk about a problem you've solved, a plugin you like, a cool blog post you read, something you're working on now, or pretty much any other way you're using javascript to achieve your goals.</p>

<p>This month, we have a lineup of awesome folks ready to share the knowldge of the ancients.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>"Node Deployment with PM2" by Karl Kirch</p></li>
<li><p>"Hubot Plugins" by Rick Yoesting</p></li>
<li><p>"Kracken JS" by Shane King</p></li>
<li><p>"Thoughtfully Establishing Postgres as the Best Data Store for Your JavaScript Application" by Rob Sullivan</p></li>
</ul>

Have you come across a useful plugin lately? Have you recently solved a hard problem with javascript or related technologies? Now is your chance to present it!</p>

<p>Since these tend to be pretty popular, we've started a 'signup' on the Google + page. By 'signup' I meann "post a comment in the thread". It's basically first come, first serve. Or FIFO. Whatever :)</p>
