<h2>About "The Event Loop (or how JavaScript works)"</h2>

<p>Have you ever wondered how Javascript works? Why synchronous calls are bad? What really happens when you use callbacks, call setTimeout, or make an ajax or database call? Is Javascript really single threaded?
The answer to all these questions and more can be found at the heart of every browser and Node.js. The Event Loop.</p>

<h2>About our Speakers</h2>

<h3>Karl Kirch</h3>

<p>SWOSU grad who's done everything from freelance work, the startup scene, and even some  government contract work. I've done frontend and backend work (and even some mobile) in everything from Java to Javascript (except C++, not a huge fan...). I don't always code, but when I do I like to do it well... When I'm not coding I'm running, playing soccer, brewing beer, or anything that doesn't involve a computer.</p>
