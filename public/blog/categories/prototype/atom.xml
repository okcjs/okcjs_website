<h2>This Month</h2>

<p>Meeting October 16, 2012 @The Exchange</p>

<h3>Mootools. Prototype.</h3>

<p>"I love Javascript. Its so bad !"</p>

<p><img class="float-left" src="/images/misc/its_so_bad.jpg" width="175" title="Javascript makes me feel like this." ></p>

<p>You know why? There is a lot of choices and a lot of variety. There are a lot of tested, mature and useful frameworks and patterns available to a developer. Each one offers insight and techniques to help him/her solve real problems and achieve real goals. Javascript is totally bad. That means "good bad", not, you know.... bad, bad.</p>

<p>One such framework is Mootools. Mootols (My Object-Oriented Tools) is a compact, modular Object-oriented js framework designed for intermediate to advanced javascript developers. Mootools is battle worn, tried and true. Its been powering sites for as long a jQuery, and has a strong userbase. The framework is extensible and modular, follows dry principles and allows for rich DOM interaction. If you've never taken Mootols for a test drive before, now is a chance to see what it can offer.</p>

<p>The next framework we will cover is Prototype. Prototype is one of the most popular Javascript libraries, and has ben around even longer than jQuery. Prototype is a framework that  "aims to ease development of dynamic web applications".  If you've never used prototype, now is a good time to see what its does. It is currently used on 3.9% of all websites.</p>
