<p><img class="float-left rounded-corner-all frisby-js" src="/images/logos/logo-frisby.png" width="250" title="&#34;Double Javascript D3 + FrisbyJs&#34;" alt="&#34;Double Javascript D3 + FrisbyJs&#34;">The first presentation will be on Frisby.js. Frisby is a REST API testing framework built on node.js and Jasmine that makes testing API endpoints easy, fast, and fun.  Frisby.js is invented by Vance Lucas</p>

<p>The second presentation will cover D3. D3 is a avaScript library for manipulating documents based on data. D3 helps you bring data to life using HTML, SVG and CSS. D3's emphasis on web standards gives you the full capabilities of modern browsers without tying yourself to a proprietary framework, combining powerful visualization components and a data-driven approach to DOM manipulation.</p>

<h2>About our Speakers</h2>

<h3>Vance Lucas</h3>

<p>Vance Lucas created his first website at the age of 12 and has been focused on web development ever since. Driven to learn more about the web to make better and more interactive websites, Vance taught himself programming with PHP and MySQL back when PHP3 was new at the age of 13. Since PHP5's release, Vance has been focused on and obsessed with object-oriented programming and the advantages it has over the traditional PHP procedural coding style. Vance created the phpDataMapper ORM library as a project to demonstrate the benefits of object-oriented code and the Standard PHP Library (SPL). Vance launched InvoiceMore, an invoicing web application as the flagship product of Actridge, LLC, a company that he founded in February 2009. Vance has recently co-founded a new business called Brightbit doing client work and consulting.</p>

<h3>Jesse Harlin</h3>

<p>Howdy! I am developer at NineCollective who specializes in client side technologies. I am an 'alpha nerd', I love my work, and I am super enthsiastic about things like Javascript, Html/Css and Unity 3D. I've been working in the web for nearly a decade, and am especially excited about the incredible attention javascript has recieved lately as a programming language. When I am not programming at work I am probably programming at home. I love using code to write algorithmic music, program robots, automate Blender, create new electronic musical instruments, and make interactive media. When I am not doing that, I am working to help enrich the programming usergroup communities, both by participating and leading.</p>

<h2>This Month: Heads Up! Location Change!</h2>

<p>The Div was an awesome place to hold our meetings for a long time. The Div is evolving now, and <a href="http://thediv.org/2012/06/18/our-new-focus-and-pivot/">shifting its focus to better serve the Oklahoma Tech Community</a>. Since they are focusing on inspiring a new generation of developers, their facility this month will be used to host a Scratch Camp, and in the future they will focus more on <a href="http://thediv.org/div-jr-program/">Div Jr</a>.</p>

<p>We are thankful for the awesome time we spent there! However, now we
need to meet at a differnt location, so for this month we are going to
meet at <a href="http://www.metrotech.edu/campuses/edc.html">MetroTech Economic Development Center</a> in <strong>Room 114</strong> (<a href="http://goo.gl/maps/2L30">view map</a>). For this building on campus you should park in Lot I, and the entrance is either entry 13 or 14.</p>

<p>Here are some maps to help you find us:<br/>

<h3>Its time to take your visualization capabilities to the next level</h3>

<p><a href="http://processingjs.org">Processing.js</a> is the sister project of the popular Processing visual programming language, designed for the web. Processing.js makes your data visualizations, digital art, interactive animations, educational graphs, video games, etc. work using web standards and without any plug-ins. You write code using the Processing language, include it in your web page, and Processing.js does the rest. It's not magic, but almost.</p>

<p>Yury is going to help us get started with Processing.js. There is a reason Processing is highly popular with lots of creative people. Processing.js brings the best of visual programming to the web, both for Processing and web developers.   Processing can help you achieve practical goals, but it can also be a means for self expression. If you've been amazed at some of the cool things happening in the browser, and are interested in being a part of the exciting changes javascript is bringing to modern development; don't miss this meeting!</p>
