<h2>About our Speaker</h2>

<h3>Waylon Flynn</h3>

<p>Waylon started out in a town with not so much as a calculus class anywhere in a 50 mile radius and began teaching himself to program when he was 11. He eventually got degrees in Physics and Math and wrote the software they use to test astronauts on the International Space Station. The first game he ever loved was Final Fantasy on the NES. Now he thinks games are the future of the world and he's dedicated his life to making life more fun.</p>
