<h2>This Month</h2>

<p>Meeting December 18, 2012 @The Exchange</p>

<h3>Javascript Lightning.</h3>

<p>&#8220;Javascript Lightning&#8221;</p>

<p>Can you believe it? This month concludes our first full year as a usergroup!</p>

<p>We though it would be a great idea to have a user driven meeting for this month. For the first part, the majority of the meeting, we will be doing lightning talks from community members. If you&#8217;ve never been involved in one of those before, its pretty simple: Its an open forum where our members can get up and talk about what they want. The talks need to be short - generally 5-10 minutes. You can cover anything that is javascript, or related to javascript. You can talk about a problem you&#8217;ve solved, a plugin you like, a cool blog post you read, something you&#8217;re working on now, or pretty much any other way you&#8217;re using javascript to achieve your goals</p>

<p>For the second part, we will have a sort of townhall related to okcjs. This is a chance for us to discuss stuff related to the future of our group, such as topics you think will be important for upcoming months or anything else.</p>

<p>This is your chance to share and be heard!</p>

<h2>This Month</h2>

<p>Meeting November 27, 2012 @The Exchange</p>

<h3>Prototype warriors.</h3>

<p>&#8220;Prototype Warriors&#8221;</p>

<p>Prototypal inheritance in JavaScript isn&#8217;t that complicated; it&#8217;s just a little&#8230;confusing. We&#8217;ll look at how JavaScript disguises its prototypes, what&#8217;s going on under the disguise, and even a few ideas on how to embrace prototypes and make them more transparent.</p>

<h2>This Month</h2>

<p>Meeting October 16, 2012 @The Exchange</p>

<h3>Mootools. Prototype.</h3>

<p>&#8220;I love Javascript. Its so bad !&#8221;</p>

<p><img class="float-left" src="/images/misc/its_so_bad.jpg" width="175" title="Javascript makes me feel like this." ></p>

<p>You know why? There is a lot of choices and a lot of variety. There are a lot of tested, mature and useful frameworks and patterns available to a developer. Each one offers insight and techniques to help him/her solve real problems and achieve real goals. Javascript is totally bad. That means &#8220;good bad&#8221;, not, you know&#8230;. bad, bad.</p>

<p>One such framework is Mootools. Mootols (My Object-Oriented Tools) is a compact, modular Object-oriented js framework designed for intermediate to advanced javascript developers. Mootools is battle worn, tried and true. Its been powering sites for as long a jQuery, and has a strong userbase. The framework is extensible and modular, follows dry principles and allows for rich DOM interaction. If you&#8217;ve never taken Mootols for a test drive before, now is a chance to see what it can offer.</p>

<p>The next framework we will cover is Prototype. Prototype is one of the most popular Javascript libraries, and has ben around even longer than jQuery. Prototype is a framework that  &#8220;aims to ease development of dynamic web applications&#8221;.  If you&#8217;ve never used prototype, now is a good time to see what its does. It is currently used on 3.9% of all websites.</p>

<h2>This Month</h2>

<p>Meeting Tuesday, August 21 at 11:30am at Oklahoma City Metropolitan Library [Ronald J. Norick Downtown</p>

<h3>Spin Kick your Javascript with Frisby.js and Data-Driven Documents[d3]</h3>

<p><img class="float-left rounded-corner-all frisby-js" src="/images/logos/logo-frisby.png" width="250" title="&#34;Double Javascript D3 + FrisbyJs&#34;" alt="&#34;Double Javascript D3 + FrisbyJs&#34;">The first presentation will be on Frisby.js. Frisby is a REST API testing framework built on node.js and Jasmine that makes testing API endpoints easy, fast, and fun.  Frisby.js is invented by Vance Lucas</p>

<p>The second presentation will cover D3. D3 is a avaScript library for manipulating documents based on data. D3 helps you bring data to life using HTML, SVG and CSS. D3&#8217;s emphasis on web standards gives you the full capabilities of modern browsers without tying yourself to a proprietary framework, combining powerful visualization components and a data-driven approach to DOM manipulation.</p>

<h2>This Month: Heads Up! Location Change!</h2>

<p>The Div was an awesome place to hold our meetings for a long time. The Div is evolving now, and <a href="http://thediv.org/2012/06/18/our-new-focus-and-pivot/">shifting its focus to better serve the Oklahoma Tech Community</a>. Since they are focusing on inspiring a new generation of developers, their facility this month will be used to host a Scratch Camp, and in the future they will focus more on <a href="http://thediv.org/div-jr-program/">Div Jr</a>.</p>

<p>We are thankful for the awesome time we spent there! However, now we
need to meet at a differnt location, so for this month we are going to
meet at <a href="http://www.metrotech.edu/campuses/edc.html">MetroTech Economic Development Center</a> in <strong>Room 114</strong> (<a href="http://goo.gl/maps/2L30">view map</a>). For this building on campus you should park in Lot I, and the entrance is either entry 13 or 14.</p>

<p>Here are some maps to help you find us:<br/>

 * <a href="http://www.metrotech.edu/campuses/springlakemap.pdf">A Map of the Springlake Campus (pdf)</a></p>

<h3>Its time to take your visualization capabilities to the next level</h3>

<p><a href="http://processingjs.org">Processing.js</a> is the sister project of the popular Processing visual programming language, designed for the web. Processing.js makes your data visualizations, digital art, interactive animations, educational graphs, video games, etc. work using web standards and without any plug-ins. You write code using the Processing language, include it in your web page, and Processing.js does the rest. It&#8217;s not magic, but almost.</p>

<p>Yury is going to help us get started with Processing.js. There is a reason Processing is highly popular with lots of creative people. Processing.js brings the best of visual programming to the web, both for Processing and web developers.   Processing can help you achieve practical goals, but it can also be a means for self expression. If you&#8217;ve been amazed at some of the cool things happening in the browser, and are interested in being a part of the exciting changes javascript is bringing to modern development; don&#8217;t miss this meeting!</p>

<h3>Knock-Out!! Your Browser</h3>

<p>This month we have a story of true victory. Users expect a modern web application to be a responsive and rich interactive experience. Users will be accessing your site from a variety of mediums, and will be expecting immediate feedback when they are interacting with the page. Don&#8217;t let this send a haymaker to your appliation!</p>

<p>This month we have two presentations lined up to get your browser down to fighting weight. In one corner we have Micah Choquette, who will teach you how to adapt your application to any viewing environment. You can &#8216;Parry and Block&#8217; and &#8216;Slip and Turn&#8217;, as a whole host of viewing resolutions and devices get thrown at your app. In the other corner, we have Michael Sarchet who will teach you how to create a highly interactive experince with knockout.js. Use the power of MVVM to Cross, Hook and Jab your clientside viewmodel. Your pages will float like a butterfly and sting like a bee!</p>

<p>Its time to weigh in. The browser is waiting for your challenge!!</p>

<h3>Something for Everyone</h3>

<p>Over the past few months, we&#8217;ve covered a variety of topics. We&#8217;ve seen javascript on the server, in the browser and even in your favorite image editor. This month, we are going to cover a topic that is important to anyone using javascript, no matter where you are working : functions !</p>

<h3>Conjunction Junction! What&#8217;s your function()?!</h3>

<p>An Entire Session on functions in JavaScript. Yep, you heard right, an hour full of bad jokes, horrible puns, internet memes, and completely unrelated references to school house rock. Oh and of course JavaScript. Join us on a magical journey from beginner to advanced to WTF (Whats that Function?!?). Along the way we will make super ultimate friends with hoisting, overloading, recursion, declaration, &#8220;type&#8221;, length, arguments, invocation and more. You&#8217;ve got a fever, and the only prescription is more functions! Now&#8230; take(your.medicine);</p>

<h2>About &#8220;Ninjas of the Javascript&#8221;</h2>

<p>Meeting March 20, 2012 from 11:30am - 12:30pm at <a href="http://thediv.org">the &lt;div&gt;</a> in Edmond, OK. Batteries not included, but lunch is!</p>

<h3>A Frontal Assault</h3>

<p>Last month, we highlighted some of the awesome things happening with
serverside javascript. Now,  this month we want to highlight some
awesome uses of javascript for the client, and for frontend designers.
We have two awesome presentations lined up that will demonstrate the
diversity and usefulness of javascript in your workflow.</p>

<h3>Photoshop Automation With Javascript</h3>

<p>Javascript is everwhere, and if you frequently work in programs such as
image editors, video editors and sound editors you might be surprised to
find Javascript in the most unlikely of places. That means as a
developer or designer, harnessing the power of scripting gives you an
incredible edge. Photoshop gives you the ability to implement javascript
for a variety of tasks, which can save you time. It is time to learn the
ancient secrets of Photoshop, and Dragon Punch™ your photoshop workflow
with the power of Javascript.</p>

<h3>Effective Clientside Patterns with the jQuery UI Widget factory</h3>

<p>Many of you use jQuery, and similarly, many of you use jQuery UI. Its
time to go beyond simply using the presets and default widgets in your
jQuery UI library. In this talk, we will cover how $.widget really
works, and how beyond its surface, using the widget factory can help you
write elegant and well organized javascript code in your next
application. Do not attend expecting a blow by blow demonstration of the
default widgets. Instead, this is for those who are looking for ways to
organize their codebase with good patterns and solve their own unique
problems with jQuery UI.  Shadow Kick™ your web application&#8217;s clientside
codebase with the awesome javascript conventions, CSS conventions and
state management afforded by jQuery UI!</p>

<h2>Rock Your World with Node.js and Socket.io!</h2>

<p>We already have a robust usergroup in terms of size, and we are attempting something ambitious - a live coding session with audience participation. We will have two speakers at our coding session, Ben Van Treese, and Rob Sullivan. Bring your laptops to the meeting if you want to participate and be blown away by live websocket awesomeness.</p>

<p>First, Ben is going to help you go full throttle from neophyte to awesome in the exciting world of Node. We are going to first cover the basics of node and then construct a small node app for the first part of the meeting. This should be a perfect entry point for those new to node, but should also be practical for those at a novice skill level. Then we will cover some more advanced material. Rob is going to join in and simulate an Enterprise environment and load for our app. Everyone interested in Node.js, websockets, and real-time communications should get something out of this presentation.</p>
